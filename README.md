Code simulating quantum graphs. 
================================

This code can be used to simulate various types of quantum graphs, from the classic ones, to open quantum graphs or non-abelian quantum graphs. 

For more on the mathematics behind it, see the related publications:

 - _Lasing on networks_, A.A. et al. , In preparation

## Installation

To install it, you need to have python3 as well as:
- python3
- numpy/scipy/matplotlib
- networkx
- multiprocessing
