Working code for non-abelian quantum graph. 

For the abelian symmetry group U(1), we recover the standard quantum graphs. 
Test file: test_NAQ_U1_closed.ipynb

Three types of open quantum graphs are implemented:
1) open graphs, test file: test_NAQ_U1_open.ipynb
2) lasing graphs, test file: test_NAQ_U1_open_pump.ipynb
2) transport graphs, test file: test_NAQ_U1_transport.ipynb
