This folder contains examples of how to use luigi workflow with netSALT

In each, run 
```
./run.sh
``` 
to run the workflow, and adjust parameters in `luigi.cfg` for the simulatoin parameters, or in `create_graph.py` for the underlying graph.

There are two options in `run.sh`, one for passive mode computations only, the other for modal interactions.
